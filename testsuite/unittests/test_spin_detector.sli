/** @BeginDocumentation
    Name: testsuite::test_spin_detector - test decoding mechanism of binary events by spin_detector

    Synopsis: (test_spin_detector) run -> test decoding mechanism of binary events by spin_detector

    Description:
    Test, whether the communication mechanism for binary neurons
    works and whether the spin detector correctly decodes binary transitions.
    Finally, setting the precision is tested.

    FirstVersion: March 2013
